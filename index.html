        <p id="intro">We love to debate not for any actual reason other than the art of argument.
            You must have a quick wit and sharp tongue if you wish to keep up intellectually with this personality
            type!

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Debater personality type is the ultimate devil’s advocate, thriving on the process of shredding
            arguments
            and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift in the wind for all to see. Debaters don’t do this because they
            are
            trying to achieve some deeper purpose or strategic goal, but for the simple reason that it’s fun. No one
            loves
            the process of mental sparring more than Debaters, as it gives them a chance to exercise their effortlessly
            quick wit, broad accumulated knowledge base, and capacity for connecting disparate ideas to prove their
            points.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">An odd juxtaposition arises with Debaters, as they are uncompromisingly honest, but will argue
            tirelessly
            for something they don’t actually believe in, stepping into another’s shoes to argue a truth from another
            perspective.</p>

        <h1>Debater Strengths that Apply to me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quick Thinkers</b>: Debaters have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to
                idea
                without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as
                they see fit.</li>
            <li><b>Charismatic</b>: People with the Debater personality type have a way with words and wit that others
                find
                intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create
                a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Debater Weaknesses that Apply to me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Very Argumentative</b>: If there’s anything Debaters enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an
                idea,
                and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which
                Debater personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.</li>
            <li><b>Insensitive</b>: Being so rational, Debaters often misjudge others feelings and push their debates
                well
                past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points
                to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How my Friendships Work</h1>
        <h4>Find People who Love to Argue</h4>
        <p>Debater personalities are quick-witted, and their primary means of expressing this is in the form of
            arguments and discussions, where they will easily spend an entire evening debating an idea they may not
            even believe in.</p>
        <h4>I'm Super Easy to Talk to!</h4>
        <p>Debaters are actually remarkably good at communicating with friends and acquaintances of other personality
            types. Their natural tendency to argue as effectively as possible means that Debaters are accustomed to
            communicating in other people’s language and frame of reference, and this translates well into normal
            conversation.</p>
        <h4>Wine and Art the of Arguing</h4>
        <p>They know how to relax and have fun too, it’s just that “fun” to Debaters – a bottle of wine and a
            discussion about the causes of and solutions to the European migrant crisis – could be described as “an
            evening from hell” by many other personalities. But Debaters are a genial and enthusiastic personality type
            for the most part, and pretty much any situation that allows for conversation and a little wordplay is an
            enjoyable outing.</p>
        <p class="quote">The epitome of Debaters’ friendships is when someone can hold their ground in these arbitrary
            debates with
            valid, rational arguments.</p>

        <h1>Career Paths</h1>
        <h4>Spontaneous Ideas</h4>
        <p>The best careers reward intellectual competency and curiosity, allowing Debaters to utilize their
            never-ending flow of ideas productively by affording a degree of spontaneity in how they engage their
            intellectual pursuits.</p>
        <h4>No Social Politics</h4>
        <p>Really it all comes down to a sense of personal freedom, for Debaters to know that they are allowed to apply
            themselves fully to understanding and solving the problems that interest them, without getting bogged down
            by social politics and trying to figure out what makes other people “tick”.</p>
        <h4>Patience is Key</h4>
        <p>The key for Debaters is to have the patience to get to a position that allows for these freedoms, to be in
            an environment long enough that not just their colleagues, but their managers and, in time, their
            subordinates, recognize what it is that they bring to the table. </p>
        <p class="quote">If there’s anything Debaters love, it’s flexing their mental muscles, and any environment that
            lets them devise new approaches, new ideas and new projects, that allows them to push the limits of their
            creativity, will benefit strongly from what Debaters bring to the table.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="flex">
        <h1>Workplace Habits</h1>
        <h4>Give us Freedom</h4>
        <p>This dynamic is clearest with Debater subordinates, as they are comfortable challenging their managers’
            ideas and have a strong (and well-expressed) dislike for restrictive rules and guidelines. Debaters back
            this unorthodox behavior with their keen minds and curiosity, and are as capable of adopting new methods as
            they are of suggesting others do so.</p>
        <h4>Over Analysis</h4>
        <p>It is as colleagues that Debaters prove most polarizing, as their passions for brainstorming, debate and
            over-analysis drive more practical, task-oriented colleagues crazy, but serve as stimulating inspiration
            for those who appreciate the innovation Debaters bring.</p>
        <h4>Work Friends</h4>
        <p>Luckily Debaters know how to relax too, and their witty wordplay, healthy sense of humor and outgoing nature
            win new friends quickly and easily. Always willing to draw on their repository of knowledge, conversations
            with Debater personalities are informative and entertaining, which makes it easy for them to be the go-to
            person for tough problems that stump more rote approaches.</p>
